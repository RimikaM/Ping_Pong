# Ping Pong using Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Overview** 
Pygame was used to make the pong game. 
The Deep Q Network built for this Ping Pong Neural Network gets better and better over time through trial and error.
It is a convolutional neural network that reads in pixel data from the game and the game score. 
Using just those 2 parameters, it learns what moves it needs to make to become better.
